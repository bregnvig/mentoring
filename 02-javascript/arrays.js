// Using forEach write out all names to the console

// Using map convert playgrounds to an array of names

// Using filter, filter out the playgrounds without description. Remember truthy/falshy?

// Using filter, find all playgrounds that has a name, that includes Ã¸rsted

// Using every, check if ever playgrounds has a position

// Using some, check whether some playgrounds are missing a description

// Using find, find the first playground that is within 100m (getDistance returns a distance in meters)
// Use the myPosition for p1, the playgrounds position for p2

// Use reduce to calculate the total distance between you (myPosistion) to all playgrounds

// Putting it all together. Get the 3 nearest playgrounds, sorted by distance, with a description
