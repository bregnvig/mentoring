/**
 * Lets start with interfaces
 * Create a interface: Coordinate
 * The coordinate interface has two properties lat and lng. Both type number
 * 
 * Create one more interface called Playground. 
 * This interface needs four string properties:
 * id, name, description & addressDescription
 * Descript and address description are optional properties
 * Finally a property called position, of type Coordinate
 */


 // Open the playgrounds.ts file, and explicitly set the type of the array to
 // be a Playground[]. Make sure everything compiles

 // Create a class called playground service. It should have a private instance variable
 // called playgrounds. Assign the playground array to this instance variable.
 // Combining some of the stuff from last time, create a method that takes an id and returns
 // the playground with the given id.


 // Create an instance of this class and call the function finding the playground with id 'legeplads.50'
 // console.log the value.

 // Our current position is 55.867945, 12.3610023. Add a method called 'closest' to the class, that finds the nearest playground.
 // There is an exported function called getDistance in the playgrounds.ts file. Use this to find the playground
